# Skyrands

Skylander names as a service!, isn't that awesome?

# Running

I hope it's just: `docker-compose up`, if it is not, please let me know.

# Legal

I don't remember where I have stolen the list name from, sorry.

Skylanders is a copyrighted name, which I think is owned by Activision or their
friends, please take a look at: www.activision.com/legal, or www.skylanders.com.
